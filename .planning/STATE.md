## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Refactor before tests: Tests on monolithic code would need rewriting after refactoring (Pending)
- Vitest over Jest: Native ES modules, Vite integration, minimal config (Pending)
- Extract physics first: Pure functions are easiest to test and most critical to verify (Pending)
- Fix mobile via responsive Tailwind: Already using Tailwind, leverage responsive utilities (Pending)
